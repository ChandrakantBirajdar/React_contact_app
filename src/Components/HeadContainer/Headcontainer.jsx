            <p>Like I mentioned above, a Contact Us page is one of the most valuable pages you can have on your site.

                But, unfortunately, many website designers might place it near the bottom of their priority list in terms of copywriting and design. Which is probably why many contact pages look like they were built in the 1990sâ€¦</p>
